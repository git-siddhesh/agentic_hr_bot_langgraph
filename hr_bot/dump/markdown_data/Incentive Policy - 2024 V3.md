HR and Strategy may at any point in time consider different/additional documents (other than the ones mentioned above) for incentive calculations if the business MIS reports are changed or add-on information is required from other MIS. 

5. HR follows DCR and Collection MIS to calculate the incentives for fresh bounce collections. HR  will  use  the  above-mentioned  documents  provided  by  Strategy,  Ops,  or  Collection departments  for  various  incentive  programs.  These  documents  should  be  shared  by  the concerned departments by pre-agreed cut-off dates, and no change requested later than these cut-off dates will be considered by HR unless recommended by the Strategy department in writing. Validation of allocations/collections, tracking the department’s internal validation trails, justifying reason for allocation/collection changes, or maintaining evidence for these is not the HR team’s responsibility and shall be done by the concerned departments/Strategy. Sometimes CBHs/ZBHs may have to change the allocation done by Strategy as per the ground situation. In such a situation, CHBs/ZBHs should provide justification for each change to Strategy,  and  Strategy  at  its  sole  discretion  will  share  final  consolidated  change recommendations  with  HR.  Such  changes  shall  be  highlighted  to  the  MD  and  the  HR department will adjust the surplus payment/recovery in next month’s incentive pay-outs. Any exceptions must be shared with MD in the body of the pay-out approval email.  
5. HR team calculates the incentives and to validate the same, HR has put in place a Maker- Checker process in which one SPOC is responsible for calculation while the other SPOC verifies the output to ensure zero discrepancies. Subsequently, the payouts are approved by CBHs/ ZBHs or RBHs (if delegated by CBHs/ZBHs for specific regions).  
5. After calculation, the HR team seeks approval from HR Head and MD. 
5. CBHs / ZBHs can delegate approval capacity to RBH /DRBH. 
5. Incentive plan for the current month along with the previous month’s payout calculation is sent to MD for approval along with Head HR approval. If any changes are highlighted in the Business  MIS  (shared  by  Strategy  or  Operations)  by  the  Distribution  or  Collection departments,  the  following  mechanism  will  apply  for  revisions  in  payout  amounts  after approval from MD: 
- Wef 1st November 2022, if the plan-wise payout variation is less than 2% of the monthly pay-out approved by MD, then HR Head approval is required for revision in the payout amount.  
- If the variation is >= 2%, the overall payout must be approved by MD again. 
10. HR team maintains the date-wise tracker of approval emails 
10. The approved incentive payout file is then shared with the finance team for pay-out. 
10. Incentive payment should be done within the next 30 days from month end. 
10. In case, if there is any delay in receiving files from other departments, Head HR approval must be taken, and 20 days extension can be given by Head HR. Any delay beyond this must be reported/justified to the MD by email (no ratification required though). 
10. Summary of incentive payments is maintained by the HR team.
