* Recruiters from HR team on receipt of such a request for rehire, either through business or through direct/indirect application, will initiate a reference check with the last two supervisors and the last two HODs (last supervisor and HoD if the employee had served in only one role). Applicant shall be considered for rehire only if internal verification is positive.

Other cases will be rehired at the same work-level.
* None of the rehire cases will be considered for a grade lower than their last grade in Aye Finance.
* The new role, salary and grade for rehire cases will be decided considering internal parity, performance, role/skill criticality, business needs, last salary and last grade.
* If the rehire application has been made within 12 months from date of leaving Aye, the offer will be computed considering as follows: Last salary drawn + Salary increment employee would have received as per annual performance rating if he/she had stayed in Aye and was appraised accordingly. If no appraisal cycle falls between the date of leaving and date of rehire, offer will be made at the last drawn salary.

# 3 Attendance Policy

## 3.1 Objective

To establish the expected standards for attendance and punctuality for all employees.

## 3.2 Workdays & Timings

| Schedule     | Head Office/Regional Office                     | Branch                               | Call Centre                |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Work Days** | 5 Days (Monday - Friday)                      | 6 Days (Monday - Saturday)            | 5 Working Days            |
| **Week Off**   | Saturday and Sunday                          | 2nd Saturday, and Sundays             | 2 Weekly-Offs             |
| **Office Timing** | 8:30 AM-6PM (Including 30 minutes of Break Timing) | 9 AM - 6PM (Including 45 minutes of Break Timing) | 9 Working Hours (Including 30 minutes of Break Timing) |

**Lunch Break:** for 30 minutes between 12:30 and 15:00 hours

**Tea Break:** 2 tea breaks adding to 15 minutes maximum

**The Business Hours (Customer Hours at Branches):** 9:30 am to 5:00pm on all work days (including working Saturdays)

### Office Timing

a) Employees working at the Head Office (HO) and Regional Office (RO) have the option of flexible working hours. 
    * They can start their work anytime between 8 am and 9.30 am.
    * They should work for 9 hours 30 minutes from their start time to complete their work day.
    * The staff would hence end their work day between 5.30 pm and 7 pm depending on their start time.

b) The branch offices have fixed working hours from 9 am to 6 pm.

c) During the winter season, the timings of HO and branches in North and East India may be altered with prior approval from the MD.

## 3.3 Administration Of Attendance

At every location, attendance is registered on HRMS. Employee must sign-in and sign-out every day to avoid deduction of leaves or salary. In case, an employee cannot sign-in or sign-out due to unavoidable factors, such attendance must be regularized by the employee and approved by the supervisor within same payroll month. No back-dated attendance regularization for previous month will be considered unless a written justification of the same is endorsed by the HOD and approved by the Head of HR. Open attendance can be provided post approval from Head of HR subject to the nature of job. 

## 3.4 Early Leaving & Late Coming

### 3.4.1 Late Coming 

i. The employees are expected to come to the office on or before the shift time.

ii. In case of some unforeseen circumstances if the staff reaches the office /branch after the assigned shift, they will be marked late. However, such late attendance must be regularized by the employee and approved by supervisor on HRMS. If such late-attendance regularization is not approved by the supervisor, such late-in will be considered as half day casual leave (CL) or half day privilege leave (PL). If there are no leave balances in employees credit, this will be taken as loss of pay (LOP). 

iii. Arriving late by over 1 hour on any work day will mean half-day leave and over 4 hours will mean one full day leave.

iv. If the employee anticipates that he/she will be arriving late, they must inform their immediate supervisor in advance.

v.  Absence from office without prior approval from the supervisor will be considered as indiscipline and will be dealt with as per Company norms. 

vi. Managers are responsible for any approval of late coming within 3 working days from the date the employee applies for regularization.

vii. Once the attendance is marked and not regularized, the loss of pay for that staff will be recorded in the payroll system and cannot be changed during that month or following month. 

### 3.4.2 Early Leaving

i. Employees leaving before the end of their stipulated shift should seek prior approval from their supervisors and the Department Head can decide for themselves.

## Creche Facility

The objective of this policy is to give a safe and nurturing environment to the children of Aye Finance employees through a reliable child care facility and by helping employees spend extra time with their children.

The policy covers all employees of Aye Finance irrespective of the function and grade. It is applicable to all female and/or male employees. For details pertaining to child's age limit, number of visits allowed to the crèche by parents during office hours, parents' responsibility during unforeseen events and other such matters, employees can connect to the respective HR SPOCs.

Working parents often miss-out on the opportunity to spend quality time with their kids. They are also careful about who their child's caretaker is. To help our employees deal with these concerns, we provide free of cost crèche facility for our employees' children. This benefit allows our employees to get their kids along with them to their work place. It also allows parents to spend extra time with their kids during work breaks and the to and fro transit to office. We believe that entering parenthood is the most crucial transition in our life. Apart from crèche, we go beyond the stipulated statutory requirements stated under the Maternity Benefits Act to support employees.

We provide crèche benefit free-of-charge under the following operating model:

* Employee can enroll the child at our existing crèche facility
* The crèche can be situated at or near employee's work location
* Aye Finance will bear the entire cost of the crèche
* Employees can contact the HR SPOC to enroll their children into the crèche.

Following guidelines must be followed as part of this policy:

* Request to be raised by sending an email or written request to the respective HR SPOC
* Parents must adhere to the rules and regulations of the respective crèche where they have enrolled their child
* The crèche will usually be operational during working days from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm (However the exact timings may differ depending on work requirements)
* Parents must contact the crèche coordinator or HR SPOC for any queries or support

Any exception to the policy has to be recommended by Department Head, validated by Head of HR and approved by the Management Council. 

## 7.6 Employee Benefits

Employees sometime require additional funds to accomplish their personal requirements like marriage in the family, renovation, education for children, festival celebration, medical emergencies etc.

## 9.4. PERFORMANCE RATING - OUTCOMES

A performance appraisal program has been established to ensure employees' professional development along with assessing the contribution of each employee towards the company's goals.

**The outcomes of the performance appraisal process are**

* Merit based annual salary increments
* Performance based annual bonus payouts
* Promotions which are driven by performance merit (provided there is a job vacancy that suits the skills of the employee)

## 9.5. ANNUAL PERFORMANCE RATING PROCESS

The Annual Performance Rating process starts with a Self Assessment by each employee of his/her performance. 
The employees are encouraged to provide factual data on their achievements and also moderate it with their shortfalls during the year.

This is followed by a face to face appraisal by the immediate supervisor. This appraisal interview is used by the Supervisor to put the employee performance in a fair perspective. NO rating is shared at this interview. The Supervisor forwards his assessment comments along with the rating recommended by him/her.

Facilitated by Head of HR, the Management Council reviews the recommended ratings from across all functions and ensures that biases towards too lenient or too exacting ratings are smoothed out and are aligned with the organizational outcomes of each function and of the Company.

The Ratings are then confirmed and are sent back to the respective Supervisors to share with the employee.

If the employee has concerns about his/her rating that cannot be resolved by the Supervisor, the same is escalated one level up the hierarchy for resolution and the same is also advised to Head of HR.

# 13. PREVENTION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

## 13.1 OBJECTIVE

The objective of this policy is to provide protection against sexual harassment of employees at workplace. It also provides a mechanism for prevention and redressal of complaints of sexual harassment and for matters connected or incidental thereto. This policy is set up to help the organization maintain a healthy working environment that is safe and free of sexual harassment and protect the right of employees to work with dignity.

Government of India has also directed companies to lay down policy on guiding this right of every employee under Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013. This policy, when applicable to women, has been written in accordance to this directive from the Govt. of India. With regard to male employees or persons from the third gender, no directive has been laid down by the Government. Hence, action in such cases will be taken as per the organizational policies. Wherever Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013 is applicable, the provisions of this act will supercede the organizational policies.

Aye Finance has a "zero tolerance" approach towards sexual harassment. Thus, this policy defines Aye Finance's position regarding employees indulging in harassing behavior and those being sexually harassed, in order to maintain a working environment free of sexual harassment in accordance with the organizational policy.

* Aye Finance's stand is that sexual harassment is a form of misconduct that undermines the integrity of employment relationships, and the culture and image of the organization. All employees have the right to work in an environment free from all forms of discrimination and conduct which can be considered harassing, coercive, or disruptive, including sexual harassment. The policy actively advocates the right of every Aye Finance employee to work in an environment free of all forms of sexual harassment verbal, written, physical, visual or otherwise.
* It is Aye Finance's policy that harassment of employees on the basis of race, region, religion, colour, national origin, ancestry, handicap, medical condition, physical features, disability, marital status, age, sexual orientation and sex, including sexual harassment is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.
* The policy believes that it impacts the morale and spirit of its employees if they are discriminated on any of the above basis points covered in previous step.
* Every employee of Aye Finance is covered under this policy from the date of joining to retirement / termination / resignation including the notice period. 
* The management shall provide all necessary assistance for the purpose of effective implementation of the various aspects of this policy, in the best interest of every employee.
* Where sexual harassment occurs as a result of an act or omission by any third party or outsider, the company shall take all steps necessary and reasonable to assist the affected person in terms of support and preventive action.
* In case the constituted Committee finds the degree of offence coverable under the Indian Penal Code, then this fact shall be mentioned in its report and appropriate action shall be initiated by the Management, for making a Police Complaint.
* A safety audit would be conducted on an annual basis for employees to proactively spot trends and eliminate them at an early stage. 


## 13.2 SCOPE

The policy is applicable to all employees - permanent, temporary, contract or any other type of employment extended by the employer in all offices (including HO, RO and Branches).

# 14. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN (PIP) POLICY

## 14.1 OBJECTIVE

This policy identifies the proactive and progressive actions a supervisor may take when an employee's performance, attendance, or
behavior is unsatisfactory (e.g., does not meet the performance or competency expectations of the position).
The performance improvement process is generally progressive in nature such that each successive step in the process is more
significant than the last.

## 14.2 SCOPE

The policy will apply in the following two instances

1. The employee's quality and/or quantity of work are below standard i.e.
    * Performance expectations are not met
    * Deadlines are missed
    * Errors are repeated numerous times
2. Employee's violates other disciplinary policy i.e.
    * Excessive absenteeism or tardiness
    * Taking unauthorized breaks
    * Poor work behavior

## 14.3 POLICY DETAILS

A performance improvement plan is developed to help the employees to be successful in the job by changing undesired behavior. The
intent is to provide sufficient structure to support excellent performance.

**PIP Process:**

i. The first step in the PIP process is for the supervisor to document the areas of the employee's performance that need
improvement. In documenting the main performance issues, the supervisor should be objective, factual and specific.
.(Refer Annexure 15 A for the PIP Documentation Format)
ii. Next, the supervisor should establish a provisional action plan for improvement, which may be adjusted based on
employee feedback in the meeting. Supervisor should make this process collaborative to help identify areas of
confusion or misunderstanding on the employee's part. This will also encourage ownership of the issue by the
employee.
iii. The development plan issued to a Grade 6 employee should be for a minimum period of one month and for Grade 5
and above the period is three months. The PIP period for any employee should not be beyond three months. During 


# AYE [आय] Aye Finance P Ltd

this period the employees' performance is reviewed and checked regularly.

iv. The PIP Documentation Form is recorded with HR in the personal file of the employee

v. A PIP notice is also issued to the employee (Refer Annexure 15B for the PIP Notice)

vi. The employee and supervisor should establish regular follow-up meetings which should be outlined in the PIP.

vii. Please note that the PIP will run concurrent to the notice period. If the outcome of the PIP is satisfactory performance, the employee shall continue with the employment. Else, the employee will be exited on the later of the end of notice period or end of the PIP.

## 18.4 Process
Aye Finance P Ltd

## Step 1: Application Process

Employees interesting in applying for the opportunity should login to AyeYo first. Go to Talent Acquisition -> Manage Jobs -> 'Internal Job Board' OR enter 'Internal Job Board' in search bar and click on search button.

Aye Finance believes that an employee is responsible for his/her career growth in the Company. As a Company, we have always nurtured an environment, which provides the employee with ample opportunities to pursue a career of his/her choice. However, to ensure transparency and objectivity in the process, an email notification will be triggered to the current reporting manager, functional manager and TA Head intimating about them about the job application.

## Step 2: Shortlisting Process

**(a)** All applications received shall be processed by the TA team to shortlist the best possible candidate(s) who fit the job description mentioned in the announcement.

**(b)** All shortlisted employees shall be informed of the same. If an employee, who has applied for an open position has not received any communication, it is deemed that the employee has not been shortlisted for the role. There would be no communication sent to employees who have not been shortlisted. Should the employee be interested in knowing the reasons for the same, he/she may contact the TA team for the same. 

## Step 3: Selection Procedure

**(a)** Personal interviews will be conducted by the hiring department's HoD and a representative from TA team, for all shortlisted candidates. For candidates in other locations, the interviews may be conducted over the phone. The HoD/TA team decides the selection process - usually it could be one or two (or a maximum of three) rounds of interviews. In case of specific positions/requirements, a suitable test to assess skills may also be used.

**(b)** Results of the interview (selection or rejection) will be communicated to the candidates jointly by the hiring department's HoD and the releasing department's HoD

### 1. Resource Movement/Transition:

If the employee is selected for the position, the date of release will be decided jointly by the Hiring HoD and the Releasing HoD. Ideally, this would be 30 days from the announcement of the selection. In no case shall this period exceed 60 days. Any exceptions may be escalated to MD by the TA Head.

After the candidates are identified for IJP, the TA team would share the list of shortlisted applications from HRMS with screenshots of applicant details along with functional head approvals and the tracker on a monthly basis to a centralized SPOC who is the checker of eligibility such that the details are available for later usage and eligibility check also. The centralized SPOC would maintain the tracker for future references.

Please note, the final decision of internal movement will be taken by the management based on business exigencies, suitability of the internal candidate to the business needs and overall fit

Please note that above policy overwrites the existing Internal Job Posting policy.

# AYE [आय] Aye Finance P Ltd

## HR follows DCR and Collection MIS to calculate the incentives for fresh bounce collections. 

HR will use the above-mentioned documents provided by Strategy, Ops, or Collection departments for various incentive programs. These documents should be shared by the concerned departments by pre-agreed cut-off dates, and no change requested later than these cut-off dates will be considered by HR unless recommended by the Strategy department in writing. **Validation of allocations/collections, tracking the department's internal validation trails, justifying the reason for allocation/collection changes, or maintaining evidence for these is not the HR team's responsibility and shall be done by the concerned departments/Strategy.** Sometimes CBHs/ZBHs may have to change the allocation done by Strategy as per the ground situation. In such a situation, CHBs/ZBHs should provide justification for each change to Strategy, and Strategy at its sole discretion will share final consolidated change recommendations with HR. Such changes shall be highlighted to the MD and the HR department will adjust the surplus payment/recovery in next month's incentive pay-outs. **Any exceptions must be shared with MD in the body of the pay-out approval email.**

* HR team calculates the incentives and to validate the same, HR has put in place a Maker-Checker process in which one SPOC is responsible for calculation while the other SPOC verifies the output to ensure zero discrepancies. Subsequently, the payouts are approved by CBHs/ZBHs or RBHs (if delegated by CBHs/ZBHs for specific regions).
* After calculation, the HR team seeks approval from HR Head and MD.
* CBHs/ ZBHs can delegate approval capacity to RBH /DRBH.
* Incentive plan for the current month along with the previous month's payout calculation is sent to MD for approval along with Head HR approval. If any changes are highlighted in the Business MIS (shared by Strategy or Operations) by the Distribution or Collection departments, the following mechanism will apply for revisions in payout amounts after approval from MD:
    * We f 1st November 2022, if the plan-wise payout variation is less than 2% of the monthly pay-out approved by MD, then HR Head approval is required for revision in the payout amount.
    * If the variation is >= 2%, the overall payout must be approved by MD again.
* HR team maintains the date-wise tracker of approval emails
* The approved incentive payout file is then shared with the finance team for pay-out.
* Incentive payment should be done within the next 30 days from month end. 
* In case, if there is any delay in receiving files from other departments, Head HR approval must be taken, and 20 days extension can be given by Head HR. Any delay beyond this must be reported/justified to the MD by email (no ratification required though). 
* Summary of incentive payments is maintained by the HR team.

### 24.7 Important points to be considered while calculating incentives

* **For incentive calculation, 2nd/3rd ACH, subsequent ACH (Re ACH), and digital payments are also considered.**
* Allocation mapping is done by the Branch Manager and Strategy, after reconciling, shall share the final report with HR.
* Docking may be done for Incentive Program at 70%-30% at 3 months defer period on the eligible amount, if specifically mentioned in the incentive plan. **For every OD case, 3 times of Net Disbursal amount will be docked.**
* HR team can either use DCR or collection MIS as approved by the Head of HR and Head of Strategy, depending on the accuracy of either report. 
* If any case is not present in DCR, Fresh & repeat disbursement file, or any other document, and the same is added by CBH / ZBH or RBH for incentive payment basis the actual allocations/collections, shall be considered for payment only if recommended by Strategy. However, such changes shall be highlighted to the MD.
* While processing the DCR report to calculate the distribution incentive, the below-mentioned points must be considered (any deviations have to be approved by Head HR and concerned CXO):
    * Exclude the previous month's collection cases
    * Exclude ACH, PDC, ECLGS, SUSPENSE, and REFUND entries 
* Exclude those cases where the difference in EMI amount is more than 500 from the collected amount 
* 1 collection is considered if the ratio of the collected amount & EMI amount is from 1 to 1.9
* 2 collections are counted if the ratio of the collected amount & EMI amount is from 2 to 2.9
* 3 collections are counted if the ratio of the collected amount & EMI amount is from 3 to 3.9
* 4 collections are counted if the ratio of the collected amount & EMI amount is from 4 to 4.9

## FAQs:

**Ans.** The number of files disbursed is required to calculate the incentives. 


**Q 2. For Repeat sourcing, is LA eligible for a repeat loan incentive? If yes, then how? As repeat loans are processed directly by Call Centre Team.**

**Ans.** Customer Service sends data to all branches and cases that get converted by LA will get incentives.


**Q 3. If 90% of the branch collection is done through ACH clearance, then how the remaining 10% of customer allocation will be done between the branch employees & how will be their incentive calculated? As per the incentive plan, we do not give incentive who collects 10 or below cases.**

**Ans.** Such high-efficiency branches will focus on disbursement and will earn incentives through disbursements.
