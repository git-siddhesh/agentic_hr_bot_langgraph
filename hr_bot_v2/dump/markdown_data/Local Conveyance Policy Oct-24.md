` `**Local Conveyance Policy**  

**Objective**  

The objective of this policy is to ascertain the Local conveyance claim process to be followed by the employees for their efforts in the field.  

**Scope**  

This policy applies to LAs, Senior LAs, Branch Collection Officers, Senior Branch Collection Officers and Branch Operations Officers.  

Employees at other grades/designations including the Distribution staff on secondment to Collections should raise claims as per the existing claim process. 

Managers will continue to raise claims based on their actual expenses. **Guidelines**  

Employees for whom an explicit plan for local conveyance calculation has been published separately, would adhere to the plan published which can be revised from time to time. Employees for whom no explicit plan has been published will claim on the basis of actual distance travelled on Vitaran app (post manager approval).

After approval from the concerned supervisors, LC payment will be done by the Finance department.  

Each employee must update their receipts on CMS/ other relevant activity at the customer location. This digital trail or receipt’s GPS location will be used to validate the claim amount. 

If receipt is not created at the customer location, local conveyance amount will not be reimbursed for that customer visit, subject to manager’s discretion. 

In any case, where the trail update / receipt creation is not done from the customer's home/branch location, the actual conveyance will not be paid for that visit. The receipt must be created only at the customer's location. Receipts created at the branch, other customer's location or any other place will not be considered. 

If an employee does not update the trail on CMS/ other relevant tracking app for any visit in the entire month, no LC shall be paid to him/her. 

The claim must be raised only after the end of the month and before the deadline specified by the Finance team (as per the Local Conveyance policy applicable to other employees). 

Any deviation on this policy will requires endorsement from the Head of the Department and approval by the CFO, Deputy CEO, or Managing Director
